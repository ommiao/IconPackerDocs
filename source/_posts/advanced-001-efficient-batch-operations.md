There are some efficient batch operations, but all of them are secrets before I post this guide!

##### 1. Add icons from file system

When you click `add icon` button and open system files, you can long press any icons and it will be multiple selection mode, then select all icons you want. All icons will be added to your category!

##### 2. Move icons to another category
